👉Need help with your projects?

I am a software engineer with 15 years of experience. Over the past 15 years, I have worked with major companies like Royal Canin (a Mars Group company), Prisma Media, Sud Ouest Group, as well as promising startups like Akeneo, Convelio, and Sunday.


👉Seeking an experienced professional?

I focus on understanding the business needs to find the best solutions. I enjoy everything ending in *DD, such as DDD, BDD, and TDD. Leveraging these concepts and eXtreme Programming values, I can assist you in building robust and sustainable software. 


👉Want to enhance your team's skills?

I love sharing my knowledge and helping individuals I work with to progress. I can help your teams make progress on technical subjects and also improve communication between technical and non-technical people through workshops like Example Mapping or Event Storming. Check out my blog at: [http://arnolanglade.github.io/blog](http://arnolanglade.github.io/blog) to explore topics I'm passionate about and discuss in depth.
